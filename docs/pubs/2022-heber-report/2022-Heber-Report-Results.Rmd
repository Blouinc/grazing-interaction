# Results


## Landscape Appearance

The figure below displays the estimated average percent utilization found on and near the Heber Wild Horse Territory (WHT) in 2021 using the landscape appearance method. In total, ten sites were monitored during 2021 during the month of June and then again in November. Five of these sites were located within the Heber WHT boundary lines and five of these sites were located outside of the Heber WHT boundary lines. The sites located on the territory include; BRL, FLO1, GETPBG, KPPJT, and SHPT. The sites located off the territory include; A51, GETO, HPT, OPO1, and STPO. 
Of the sites found on the Heber WHT, the largest difference in utilization levels between the two monitoring periods was found at the GETPBG site. The observed utilization levels at the GETPBG site were 8.4% in June and increased to 23% in November. The BRL site use levels were 2.5% in June and increased to 3.6% in November. The SHPT site use levels were 2.5% in June and increased to 4.6% in November. The FLO1 site use levels were 14% in June and decreased to 12% in November. The KPPJT site use levels were 3.6% in June and decreased to 2.5% in November. These results show that four out of the five sites were observed to have nearly less than a 2% difference in use between the two monitoring periods.
The utilization levels for the off-territory sites varied significantly more during the two monitoring periods. The A51 site use levels were 80% in June and decreased to 25% in November. This was the largest difference in utilization levels observed among all the sites monitored with a decrease of 55% in use. The GETO site use levels were 15% in June and decreased to 7.8% in November. The HPT site use levels were 29% in June and decreased to 4.6% in November. The OPO1 site use levels were 62% in June and decreased to 14% in November. The STPO site use levels were 9.8% in June and increased to 13% in November. The STPO site was the only off-territory site that saw utilization levels increase from June to November.
Based on these landscape appearance estimates, apparent use appears to be lower at the on-territory sites than it does at the off-territory sites. The estimates show that utilization was higher during the month of June than it was in November for the off-territory sites, excluding the STPO site which saw an increase of approximately 3% in utilization. Of the ten sites monitored, only two sites, (A51 & OPO1) were estimated to have heavy (61-80%) use based on the utilization class descriptions used during the Landscape Appearance Method.
